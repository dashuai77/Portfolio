## Step one: the visualization

The resaon I selected this data visualization is that advertsing is very important for many tech companies. The advertising spending accounts for a very high proportion of many companies' spending, through redesigning this data visualization, we can find which advertising method is more popular in recent years and help companies find the best advertising method to promote their products. 

## Step two: the critique

 ### The summary of critique

This data visualization used line charts to display the trend of the proportion of different types of advertising expenditure. Through line charts, I can clearly understand the popularity of which advertising method has increased significantly in recent years. But this data visualization also had many disadvantages. For example, using proportion may be less intuitive than using numbers. Although we can understand which advertising method has become more popular, it’s difficult for us to understand the growth range or decline range in spending for each advertising method. To improve it, I would use the numbers to replace the proportion as the advertising spending and add an increase or decline ratio to the chart which will help us understand the changing situation of different advertising methods’ spending better. 

I think the primary audience for this tool is advertising agencies or advertisers. I think this data visualization may give these audiences some insights, but not very effective  for reaching that audience. Because when advertising agencies or advertisers advertise the product, they need to know the specific numbers of different advertising methods’ spending. If only based on the proportion, they can’t confirm the overall advertising spending of this year. In addition, advertising agencies always focus on the popular advertising methods, some less attracting advertising methods may not be very useful for them.

I think this method is successful at evaluating the data visualization. Because it focuses on many different aspects to help us know if it is easier for audiences to understand the main topic of data visualization. The first change to this data visualization is the color. The colors of some advertising methods such as Direct Mail ,Radio and Out-of-home are very close which make it difficult for audiences to distinguish them. We can use more contrasting colors to represent different advertising methods. The second change is the type of visualization. In this line chart, we can see some lines are crossing together which is difficult for audiences to check out the specific numbers. I would change the line chart to the bar chart, through bar charts, we can separate the spending of each advertising method in every year which is clearer for our audiences to understand. 


## Step three: Sketch a solution



## Step four: Test the solution

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
