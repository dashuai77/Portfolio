# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Change 1: Title of dashboards

To make the overall design of dashboard clearer, I add specific titles for each dashboards. For dashboard which shows the overview impact of remote work on real estate, I use a title to show that it's the current situation of remote work in United States. When audiences see these dashboards, they can understand tha main topic and struture of whole data story through titles. In addition, an explicit title can make audiences navigate the charts more conveniently.

Change 2: Color of some data visualizations

To help audiences find the differences of remote work ratio in each state, I used more constrast colors in the map to make the difference between each state more obvious. At the meantime, I include some standardization between the colors to make the overall style of dashboard more unified which will help audiences understand the relationship between each data visualization better. 

Change 3: Outline of data story 

To help audiences get useful insights from my data story, I adjust the outline of the data story. Expect to foucs on New York City to show the impact of remote work on two different types of real estate price includig residential real estate and commerical real esate, I add a dashboard to constrast the remote work ratio and residential real estate average price in Top 5 states, the remote work ratio and commerical real estate average price in Least 5 states. Through the state dimension, the correlation between remote work ratio and real estate price can be reflected more clearly. 


## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

The target audience of my final data story is real estate investor. Real estate investors always tend to be more concerned about choosing the right time and place to invest. In my final data story, I foucs on the the correlation between remote work ratio and average price of real estate. To help my audiences understand whcich region will be more suitable for investment, I use a map and some KPI values to show the overview impact of remote work on real estate by each state in the United states. Through this dashboard, my audiences can have a better understand of the impact of remote work on real estate in different region which will help them choose the best place to make an investment. Through foucs the impact of remote work on one city (New York), I compare trends in remote work ratio and real estate price over 7 years whcih can make audiences understans when is the best time to invest. 

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

In my data story, I need to make some necessary design decisions. I think the most important design decision I made is layering the content of whole data story. Though introducing the overview impact of remote work ratio on real estate at first, I can make my audiences have a general idea of what this data story is about. After that, through different dimensions, such as region or time, to make audiences understand the specific impact of remote work on different types of real estate. Through this way, audeinces can have a clearer understanding of the overall structure of the data story which will also make them remember this data story more deeply.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.

In my whole data story, I think there are some other points worth discussing. For example, if the remote work ratio increases continually, what policies will the US government implement to decrease the negative impact of remote work on commerical real estate. I think it's an interesting topic, because the commerical real estate economy has a close connection with the loans of many banks. When the price and demand of commerical real estate decreases continally, it may cause a serious economic crisis in the United States. So I think there will be many interesting points can be talked about for this topic.
