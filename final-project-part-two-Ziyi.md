# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

The target audiences of my project will be real estate developers and real estate investors. To identify representative individuals to interview, I will consider who will be influenced by the topic of my project. Due to the topic of my project is the impact of remote work on real estate, I chose some people who have already worked remotely for a while or will work remotely in the future. Through interviewing with them, I will understand how people really feel about working remotely and their thoughts on whether remote work will affect real estate. 

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| To identify whether my wireframe can clearly show the topic of my project.| Do you think these wireframes can help you get a clear understanding of the relationship between remote work and the real estate economy?|
| To make me understand whether my wireframe can help my target audiences find useful insights which can help them make more thoughtful decisions.|   Do you think these wireframes can help my intended audiences such as real estate developers or real estate investors make more informed decisions？|
| To find more effective ways to help me incorporate more stronger story components in my wireframes and final project.| Are these wireframes storytelling? If not, where do you think my wireframe could be improved to enhance its storytelling？|
| To help me do a final check to see if there's anything missing or anything unclear in my wireframes.| Is there anything that confuses you about these wireframes?|


## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.


| Questions               | Interview 1 (A tech company employee who has already worked remotely for 4 years) | Interview 2(A CMU student who will graduate this year and join a tech company as a data scientist) | Interview 3(An real estate investor who has 10 years experience) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Do you think these wireframes can help you get a clear understanding of the relationship between remote work and the real estate economy? | I think these wireframes are relatively clear. It seems that you compare the remote work ratio with the price of two typical real estate, residential real estate and commercial real estate. In this wireframe, I guess when the remote work ratio increases, the price of commercial real estate will decrease, otherwise the price of residential real estate will increase. | I like the chart type which represents the relationship between remote work and real estate. This wireframe combines a line chart and bar chart to show the trend of remote work ratio and the price of real estate. I think it’s a good way to show the relationship between remote work and the real estate economy.| It seems clear to me, because I have some experience with this situation. But for some people without a similar work background like me, they may be confused about the relationship between remote work and real estate.|
| Do you think these wireframes can help my intended audiences such as real estate developers or real estate investors make more informed decisions?| I think your wireframe shows a clear relationship between remote work and real estate, but it’s not enough to help your audiences get many useful insights. Because the price of real estate will be influenced by lots of factors. Although remote work may be one of the most important factors, I still recommend you consider other factors and contrast them with the remote work to check out which factors will have a bigger impact on real estate.| I think your wireframes can give your audiences some basic insights, and you need to focus on some other aspects to help your audiences acquire more thoughtful insights. I would suggest you consider the influence of remote work in different industries. Because people in different industries have various work environments and demand for residential real estate. The impact of remote work on real estate will be different in specific industries. | Based on my previous work experience, I think your wireframes are relatively simple for your audiences. Real estate investment is a very difficult business, some experienced investors have already understood the relationship between remote work and real estate. I suggested you explore deeper content about the relationship between real estate and remote work, such as from the perspective of economic policy of the US government analyzing this question. |
| Are these wireframes storytelling? If not, where do you think my wireframe could be improved to enhance its storytelling？|  To be honest it’s not very good storytelling. Your wireframes are bland for me. To enhance its storytelling is not easy work. Based on my experience, I think you can add a true story about a person you are familiar with. If you have a friend who works remotely these years, you can share his/her thoughts or feelings about remote work. I guess it’s a good way to enhance your wireframes storytelling. | I think your wireframes are storytelling enough. These wireframes can make me feel like hearing an unforgettable story. | My answer will be no. Your wireframes lack many impressive features and make me feel like listening to a report. For your wireframes, I think one of the most useful ways which can improve its storytelling is using research or some case studies to help your audiences have a clear understanding of your project background. Through some research about the relationship between remote work and real estate, your wireframes will show more story components. |
|Is there anything that confuses you about these wireframes?| I think your wireframes don’t have left too much out so far, and most of the content is clear. | Everything seems clear, and you could just change the background or color of your map which shows the work remotely ratio in each state. Because it seems that the difference between each state is not very high, you can use more contrast colors or a dark background. | Because your content is not very complicated, these wireframes are clear to me. But one thing I want to emphasize is that you could change the title of the visualization which shows the relationship between real estate price and remote work ratio. The ‘price’ can make people confused, ‘average price’ will be more accurate.|


# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  The wireframes are relatively clear, but these wireframes may not give enough useful insights to the target audiences.| In addition to the remote work ratio, the price of real estate will be influenced by lots of factors. So I will include other factors which can influence the price of real estate  in my wireframes and contrast them with the remote work to check out which factors will have a bigger impact on real estate.|
|  The wireframes are not storytelling enough. They are relatively bland which will not impress the audiences. | To enhance wireframes’ storytelling, I will add a true story about my friends or my family who worked remotely these years and share their thoughts or feelings about remote work. In addition, I will use research or some case studies to show the background of my project, which will be a good way to include more story components in my wireframes. |
|  The content of the wireframes is relatively simple for the audiences who have experience in this area. They can’t acquire thoughtful insights from my wireframes.| I will consider the influence of remote work in different industries. For people in different industries, they will have various work environments and demand for residential real estate. I think it’s a good entry point to talk about how the impact of remote work on real estate will be different in specific industries. In the meantime, I will analyze the impact of remote work on real estate from the perspective of the US government economic policy.|
| The color and title of some wireframes is not clear. |  For this observation, I will use more contrast colors in the map to show the difference of remote work ratio between each state. In addition, to avoid confusing some audiences, I will change the title of my wireframe from ‘Commercial Real Estate Price VS. Remote Work Ratio in NY’ to ‘Commercial Real Estate Average Price VS. Remote Work Ratio in NY’. |

> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

To improve my wireframes, I need to consider whether the wireframes can make target audiences get enough useful insights. More importantly, the storytelling of wireframes will make your audience impressed by your story and keep your project reaching the end goal.
