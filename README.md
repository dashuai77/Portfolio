# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  My name is Ziyi Shan.

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. List item #1
2. List item #2
3. List item #3

or...

- List item #1
- List item #2
- List item #3
